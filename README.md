🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning
This project explores and predicts loan approval status using supervised machine learning models. It includes end-to-end steps: data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as:

Gender, Marital Status, Dependents

Education, Employment

Income, Loan Amount, Credit History

Property Area

Target: Loan_Status (Y/N)

📄 Data source: Uploaded manually (loan_prediction.csv)

📊 Project Workflow
Data Loading & Cleaning

Removed Loan_ID

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized trends using Plotly

Analyzed feature relationships with Loan_Status

Feature Engineering

Converted categorical variables to numeric using one-hot encoding

Engineered features like TotalIncome (Applicant + Coapplicant)

Model Building

Trained and evaluated multiple models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest Classifier

Model Evaluation

Used Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

Compared training vs test performance

🧪 Results
Best accuracy achieved with: Random Forest Classifier

Insight: Features like Credit_History, ApplicantIncome, and LoanAmount had a major impact on loan approval.
